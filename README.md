- How many votes were cast in this congressional election.
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county
- Which county had the largest number of votes.
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the toal votes.

## In Summary:

> The election audit script can quickly run through millions of votes in a very short amount of time. With a total of 163 lines of code, it can be manipulated to        itterate through any CSV files it is given. The CSV must be in the standard voter format before running the code. 
>
> The "file_to_load" location can be easily changed in the code behind the script as shown below. simply copy and paste where your voter data csv file is located and then run the script.
